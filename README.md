# Legacy Roblox
This theme makes Roblox look how it did before 2020, with many customizable options. This should be used along my userscript, [Old Roblox Header](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/448131-old-roblox-header).

## Credits
Forked from [tersiswilvin](https://github.com/tersiswilvin)'s fork of the Roblox 2019 Old Theme, which was originally made by GalactiCosmo.
